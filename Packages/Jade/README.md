# Jade.tmbundle

**This was made specifically for Sublime Text 2. It might also work in Textmate but it's untested**

A **TextMate Bundle** for the **Jade** templating language. Implemented in
JSON-tmLanguage, a compiled tmLanguage version is included. All language
features that I know of and some indent increase/decrease patterns are
implemented.

A test.jade file is included with all features I know, it is a valid file, so
you can compile it with jade to check its output.

## Installation
